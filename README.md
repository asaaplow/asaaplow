### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I am Alejandro Salazar, I am a passionate Computer Science student with a great interest in software development and technology.
My GitHub repository shows some of my projects, ranging from simple web app applications to other much more complex applications or projects. 
I am always willing to collaborate with other developers and contribute to open source projects, as I believe that teamwork and knowledge sharing
are crucial for personal and professional growth.
